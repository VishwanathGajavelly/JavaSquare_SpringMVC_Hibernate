# Application: JavaSquare_SpringMVC_Hibernate 

# Author: Vishwanath Gajavelly

This is My website which is yet to be deployed and a lot more to do. Currently I'm ready with just a Feedback form. Server side is being managed by Spring MVC configurations, connected to PostgreSQL Database using Hibernate API. Front End Technologies used: HTML, CSS.

### To be developed: 
1. Fill the pages with content.
2. Youtube Developer API to display the videos I upload on youtube.
3. Configure the Paypal API to receive any generous donations, I promise to use them only to pay for my coffee ðŸ˜‰
4. A neat display of courses. Cannot wait to inherit my angular skills.
5. Develop student profiles, where he can view his registered courses, his/her courses timings and course-wise results. 
6. Never Ending User Interface improvements.

## Status: Temporarily on hold. 

#### Advancements expected:
1. Have plans to develop a Single Page Application using Angular JS, will start as soon as I'm done with the developments in this project.


## Update: 
> Created a new Design, implemented Bootstrap and Angular.js concepts making it fully responsive and more user friendly. Haven't yet configured the middleware for that design. The code for the new Design can be accessed at the following link https://github.com/VishwanathGajavelly/JavaSquare_FrontEnd
