# Application: JavaSquare_SpringMVC_Hibernate 

# Author: Vishwanath Gajavelly

This is My website which is yet to be deployed and a lot more to do. Currently I'm ready with just a Feedback form. Server side is being managed by Spring MVC configurations, connected to PostgreSQL Database using Hibernate API. Front End Technologies used: HTML, CSS.

### To be developed: 
1. Fill the pages with content.
2. Youtube Developer API to display the videos I upload on youtube.
3. Configure the Paypal API to receive any generous donations, I promise to use them only to pay for my coffee ðŸ˜‰
4. A neat display of courses. Cannot wait to inherit my angular skills.
5. Develop student profiles, where he can view his registered courses, his/her courses timings and course-wise results. 
6. Never Ending User Interface improvements.

## Status: Temporarily on hold. 

#### Advancements expected:
1. Have plans to develop a Single Page Application using Angular JS, will start as soon as I'm done with the developments in this project.
